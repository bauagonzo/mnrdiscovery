#mnrdiscovery

```mnrdiscovery``` is a CLI to test devices accessibility from EMC SRM and other M&R products.

#Description
That script can be used in the SRM installation to connect to the MnR Discovery page and run the test functionality for the discovered devices. The results of the test can be sent to the SRM administrator so he can fix any problem proactively. 

#Use Cases

1. The script is installed within an SRM task in one of the backend and an email is sent to the SRM administrator with the script results attached. 
2. The script is installed within an SRM task and the results are sent within traps to the Alert Consolidation module so the test that failed result in an Alert that is added to the events databases and sent by email. 


#Usage
The script can be run on any server that can reach the SRM FrontEnd WebService. If it's run outside of the SRM Frontend server the hostname parameter is a must. 
```shell
ruby mnrdiscovery.rb --help                                                                                                                          1 â†µ
